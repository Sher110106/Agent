   - Update the KV namespace ID in `wrangler.toml`

3. **Development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Upload & Analyze**

- AI performs comprehensive statistical analysis
- System generates data quality assessment and insights

### 2. **Automatic Dashboard**
- Multiple charts generated instantly based on data characteristics
- Overview charts, trend analysis, and distribution visualizations
- Professional styling with interactive features

### 3. **AI-Powered Insights**
- Deep analysis of patterns, correlations, and business insights
- Data quality scoring and recommendations
- Suggested questions tailored to your specific dataset

### 4. **Interactive Querying**

## üìù Example Queries

The system generates dynamic suggestions based on your data, but here are some examples:

**Trend Analysis:**
- "Show me revenue trends over the past year"
- "Create a line chart of monthly growth rates"
- "Display seasonal patterns in the data"

**Comparisons:**
- "Compare performance across different categories"
- "Show me a bar chart of top 10 products by sales"
- "Create a scatter plot showing correlation between price and rating"

**Distributions:**
- "Display the distribution of customer ages"
- "Show me a histogram of transaction amounts"
- "Create a pie chart of market share by region"

## Sample Data

A sample CSV file (`sample-data.csv`) is included for testing with revenue, expenses, and profit data across different months and categories.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /upload` - Upload and process CSV files
- `POST /query` - Generate charts from natural language queries
- `GET /` - Access the web interface

## Environment Variables

- `ENVIRONMENT`: Set to "development" or "production"

## Architecture Details

The system follows a simple flow:
1. CSV upload ‚Üí Parse and infer schema ‚Üí Store in KV
2. User query + dataset ID ‚Üí Build structured prompt ‚Üí Workers AI ‚Üí Chart specification
3. Frontend renders chart using Plotly.js
