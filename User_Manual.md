- **Consistent categories**: Use same spelling and capitalization
- **Meaningful groupings**: Include relevant categorical variables
- **Time periods**: Include date/time information when possible

#### **Question Strategy**
1. **Start broad**: "What are the main patterns in my data?"
2. **Drill down**: "Why do sales spike in December?"
3. **Compare segments**: "How do premium vs standard customers differ?"
4. **Find relationships**: "What factors predict customer satisfaction?"

### **Business Context**

#### **Frame Your Data**
- **Revenue data**: Focus on trends, seasonality, regional differences
- **Customer data**: Look for segmentation, behavior patterns, satisfaction drivers
- **Operational data**: Identify efficiency patterns, bottlenecks, improvements
- **Marketing data**: Track campaign effectiveness, channel performance, ROI

#### **Ask Business Questions**
```
"What drives our highest revenue periods?"
"Which customer segments are most profitable?"
