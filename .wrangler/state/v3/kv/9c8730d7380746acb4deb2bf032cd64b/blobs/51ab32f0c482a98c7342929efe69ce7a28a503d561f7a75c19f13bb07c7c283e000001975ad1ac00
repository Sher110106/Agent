{"summary":"The dataset contains 2976 hourly weather observations from May 1, 2025, capturing atmospheric conditions including barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind patterns, rainfall, solar radiation, and a comfort index. Key characteristics include stable barometric pressure, moderate temperature variability, and low rainfall incidence. The data shows consistent recording intervals with minimal missing values.","insights":["Barometric pressure remains tightly clustered around 1001.3 hPa with minimal variation (Â±3.5 hPa), indicating stable atmospheric conditions","Solar radiation shows extreme variability (0-740 W/mÂ²) with a median of 30 W/mÂ², suggesting significant diurnal patterns","Comfort Label is predominantly 'Medium' (71% of records), with 'Low' occurring 22% of the time and 'High' only 6.5%","Rainfall occurs in only 0.65% of observations with a mean of 0.02mm, indicating arid conditions","Prevailing wind direction is most frequently NE (13% of total observations) followed by ENE (18%)"],"correlations":[{"column1":"Temp Â°C","column2":"Hum %","correlation":-0.32},{"column1":"Solar Rad W/m^2","column2":"Temp Â°C","correlation":0.68},{"column1":"Avg Wind Speed -
