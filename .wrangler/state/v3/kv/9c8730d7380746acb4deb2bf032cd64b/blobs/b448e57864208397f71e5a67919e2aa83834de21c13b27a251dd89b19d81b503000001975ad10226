{"summary":"The dataset contains 2976 hourly weather observations from May 1, 2025, including barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, rainfall, and solar radiation. Key characteristics show stable barometric pressure, moderate temperatures (mean 30.6Â°C), and low rainfall incidence. Wind patterns favor easterly directions, with solar radiation showing high variability.","insights":["Barometric pressure remains tightly clustered around 1001.3 hPa with minimal variation (Â±3.5 hPa), indicating stable atmospheric conditions","98.5% of rainfall measurements are 0 mm, suggesting arid conditions with rare precipitation events","Prevailing wind directions are predominantly NE (38.6% of entries) and ENE (17.8%), creating predictable wind patterns for energy planning","Solar radiation shows extreme variability (std dev 241 W/mÂ²) with median 30 W/mÂ² vs max 740 W/mÂ², indicating significant diurnal fluctuations","Temperature and humidity show inverse relationship (implied by statistical distributions)"],"correlations":[{"column1":"Temp ï¿½C","column2":"Hum %","correlation":-0.62},{"column1":"Solar Rad W/m^2","column2":"Avg Wind Speed -
